## simple-gpa-calc

# Summary
In this project I used the Tkinter module in Python to create a GUI where a user can enter the number of semesters they have completed in college, the number of classes they have taken, and the letter grade and number of credits associated with each class. By creating Class, Semester, and College objects which contain GPA calculators after the user inputs all the data, the overall GPA can be displayed in the main screen.
